=== Observations

Some noteworthy phonemes or letters:

* /v/, like English _valve_, written ⟨v⟩.
** Often corresponds with Mandarin /w/ or /hu/.
* /ɲ/, like Spanish _piñata_, written ⟨ny⟩.
** /ɲ/ appears only word-initially, /n/ appears only word-finally.
* About ⟨z⟩:
** /tʃ/ before /a/, and /tɕ/ before /i/;
** /tɕe/, /tɕo/, /tɕu/ vary freely with /tʃe/, /tʃo/, /tʃu/, but is always
spelled ⟨z⟩ and not ⟨zi⟩.
* About ⟨c⟩, realisation and spelling work the same way that ⟨z⟩ does.
* About ⟨w⟩:
** appears otherwise only marginally e.g. 哇 (_wa_, interjection of surprise);
** with a null initial, /u/ is spelled ⟨wu⟩.
* About ⟨i⟩:
** the iotised nuclei are spelled with ⟨y⟩ instead of ⟨i⟩;
** with a null initial, /i/ is spelled ⟨yi⟩.
