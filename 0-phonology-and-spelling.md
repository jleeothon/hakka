# Phonology and spelling

This is the phonology of Hakka spoken around Zhongshan, Guangdong Province.

It is similar to that of other Sinitic languages. For example, there are
contrasting pairs of aspirates and unaspirates.

I shall be using a transliteration based on Hagfa Pinyim.

### Consonants

Some consonants can only appear at the syllable onset, at the coda, or some at both.

Note 1: ⟨z, c, s⟩ are used before all vowels; before ⟨i⟩ it indicates a /ɨ/ in
some neighbour dialects (albeit not my family's), whereas ⟨j, q, x⟩ indicate
that the next vowel is /i/, but it avoids non-simple Roman letters is built on a
precedent by Hanyu Pinyin.
